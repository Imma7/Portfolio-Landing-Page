    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am <span style="color: red;"><strong>Immanuel Mugambi</strong></span> currently a student at Moringa School. I studied until university. My current hobbies are hiking, travelling and watching movies. A skill i have been working on is having the ability to work under pressure and adaptability.</p>
    <p>I decided to take this programming class because i've always been interested in coding and i've been curious on how the development side works.</p>
